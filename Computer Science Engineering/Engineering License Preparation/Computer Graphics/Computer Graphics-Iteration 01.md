# CRT
Cathode Ray Tube
The operations of most video monitors are based on standard CRT.
A beam of electrons emitted by an electron gun is also called as cathode rays.
# DDA
Digital Differential Analyzer
# Random scan display
refresh rate=30-60 times per second
Draws a picture one line at a time.
# Raster Scan display
refresh rate=60-80 times per second
Electron beam is swept across screen from top to bottom.
Interlaced refresh(each frames displayed in two passes)
Shadow mask methods are used.
# Frame buffer memory
a system with 24 bits per pixel and a screen resolution of 1024 by 1024 requires mega byte of storage for frame buffer
1024 x 1024 x 24/8=3MB.
Also called as refresh buffer.
# Bitmap
1 bit per pixel
# Pixmap
Multiple bits per pixel
# Flicker
Refresh rate near 60 frames per second to avoid flickering.
# Video monitors
Aspect ratio
# Resolution
The maximum number of points that can be displayed without overlap on a CRT is called resolution.
# Window
World coordinate area selected for display is called as window.
# Viewport
Device's coordinates.
# Illumination model
lighting model
# Fitting a function to a set of data points
least squares algorithm.
# HLS 
Hue
Lightness 
Saturation
# Depth-buffer
Z-buffer
# Newton-Raphson
Finding roots of nonlinear equations.
# Transformation matrices
