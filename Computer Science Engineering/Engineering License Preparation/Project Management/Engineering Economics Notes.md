# Father of economics
Adam Smith
# J.S. Mill
Economics is the practical science of the production and distribution of wealth.
# Division of economics
- consumption
- production
- exchange
- distribution
# Marginal utility
- utility=satisfaction.
- satisfaction derived by single unit of consumption.
# Cost Elements
- Material
- Labor
- Expenses
# Opportunity cost
- the contribution to income that is foregone by not using a limited resource in its best use.
# Sunk cost
- the cost that has already been incurred by past actions.
# Marginal cost
- **Additional cost** that would result from increasing the rate of output by a single unit.
- marginal=extra
# Compound Interest
see notes copy
# Time value of money
A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future.
Money is worth more in the present than in the future.
Time value of money evaluates present value of future cash flows.
Time value of money is used in discounted cash flow analysis and investment decision-making.
## Factors in time value of money
- **interest rate** (key factor)
- inflation
- time period
But tax rate is not a factor in time value of money.
# Future value
see notes copy
# Internal rate of return
- is a measure of the rate of return on an investment.
- discounted cash inflow=discounted cash outflow.
- considers time value of money.
- evaluates profitability of a project or investment.
- value of stock
- should I invest in this company?
# Effective Rate, Nominal Rate
>A statement that the "interest rate is 10%" means that interest is 10% per year, compounded annually. In this case, the nominal annual interest rate is 10%, and the effective annual interest rate is also 10%. However, if compounding is more frequent than once per year, then the effective interest rate will be greater than 10%. The more often compounding occurs, the higher the effective interest rate.

Given interest rate=nominal interest rate.
If compounded more frequently=effective interest rate increases.

# Cost of capital
required return needed on a project or investment to make it worthwhile.
# Discount rate

To calculate present value of future cash flows.
# WACC
= discount rate for a new project
# Cash flows
## Beginning of period
- rent
- lease
- insurance payments
## End of period
- O&M
- salvages and revenues
- overhauls
# Comparing alternatives in economics
- Cost-Benefit analysis
- net present value and internal rate of return
- benefit cost ration and pay back period
# Net Present Value
- +ve means that the project is expected to generate more cash flows than the initial investment.
- has direct relationship with economic value.
# Inflation
- difficult to measure because different goods different increment/decrement in price.
- inflation rates are measured by Wholesale Price Index(WPI), Producer's Price Index(PPI), Consumer's Price Index(CPI).
# MARR
- minimum attractive rate of return
- least interest rate among all alternative projects.
- helps to define **minimum** profitability for a company to undertake investment.
- sets the **lower limit** for rate of return.
## Considerations for determining MARR
- type of organization involved.
- projects available and their purpose.
- money for project and its source and cost.
# Payback period
- number of years required to recover the initial investment.
- it focuses on liquidity.
- **IT IS NOT A MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY.**
- initial-investment/future cash flows=payback period
- is simple to calculate and understand.
- **ignores** cash flows after the **payback point** has been reached. i.e **doesn't considers** cash flows of entire life of the project.
- ignores **time value of money**.
- simple payback period, if calculated payback period< standard payback period===>ACCEPT the project.
# External rate of return
- output of project vs output of market.
# Break even analysis
- revenue=cost
- no profit, no loss point.
# Equivalent worth methods
present worth=future worth=annual worth.
formulas:
# To study later these formulas.
# VAT rate
13%
# Penalty for late filing of corporate tax returns in Nepal
1% of the tax due per month.
# Expenses deductible from taxable income
- salary/wages
- rent
- utilities
- depreciation
- amortization
# Corporate tax
- public limited companies
- private limited companies
- partnerships
- 30%
# Depreciation
- income tax act,2002
- to calculate net profit
- decrease in value of assets due to their use in production process or reduction in market value or obsolescence. 
## Claim
- own the asset by the person claiming the depreciation.
- use the asset to produce income.
- fixed asset.
- can't claim depreciation on all depreciable assets.
## can't claim
- trading stock
- business asset
- non-business chargeable asset
## Rate of depreciation
### Pool A
- 5%
### Pool B
- Furniture
- office equipment
- computer
- 25%
### Pool C
- 20%
### Pool D
- 15%
**Accelerated rate of depreciation=1/3**

## Types of depreciation
- tax
- economic
# effective interest rate from nominal interest rate
