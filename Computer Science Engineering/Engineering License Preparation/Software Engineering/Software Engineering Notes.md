# Good software
- software isn't manufactured in the classical sense, it's developed or engineered.
- software doesn't "wear out".
- software can be custom built or custom build.
- maintainability
- functionality
- firmness
- commodity
- delight
# Software design principle
- no tunnel vision
- don't reinvent the wheel
# Software Engineering
is defined as systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach for the development, operation and maintenance of software.
# RAD
- Rapid Application Development
- less than 90 days software.
- 5 phases
- user needs to be involved in RAD and prototyping to get desired output.
## drawbacks
- requires highly skilled devs.
- it increases the component reusability.
# Software project management
- project planning
- scope management
- project estimation
# Software requirement specification(SRS)
- functional requirement
	- **functionality, portability and reliability** isn't functional requirement. They're non-functional requirements.
	- business needs is a functional requirement.
- non-functional requirement
- goals for implementation
- doesn't contain the algorithm for software implementation.
- unambiguous.
- also called black box specification.
# Waterfall model
- simplest model of SDLC.
- not suitable to accommodate changes.
# Evolutionary process model
- incremental, concurrent development and WINWIN spiral model isn't relate to it.
# Verification and validation model
- V-model
# System analysis
- understand software limitations.
- learning system related problems.
- impact of project on organization and personnel.
- study of an existing system.
# Architectural design

- operating procedures
# Spiral model
- risk management is most important feature.
- two dimensions
	- radial
	- angular
- risk analysis performed on every loop.
- spiral and prototyping model doesn't necessitate defining requirements at the earliest in the lifecycle.
- barry boehm founder
# Prototyping model
- vertical
- horizontal

- large scale re-use
# Performance
architecture and system characteristic
# System organization styles

Component based software engineering
Benefits
- quality better
- delivery time quicker
- productivity higher
## Properties of components
- independent
- standardized
- deployable
- documented
Examples: EJB,COM+,.NET
Component interfaces defines a set of standards for components, including interface standards, usage standards, and deployment standards.
# Client server architecture
- protocols used by server is used to communicate.
# Design heuristic
- Evaluate first iteration of the program structure to reduce coupling and improve cohesion.
- Desirable: More fan-in, less fan-out. Fan-in is the incoming modules and fan-out is the outgoing modules. outgoing means controller so less good.

# Design
- input information requirements.
- output data and program structure, interface characteristics, and procedural detail.
# Architecture is not the operational software
Rather, it enables a software engineer to
- design vs requirements?
- architectural alternatives?
- reduce risks.
# Testing
- evaluating deliverables to find errors.
# Cyclomatic complexity
It tells us about how complex a given function is.
If a function has 0 conditional statements, the cyclomatic complexity of the function will be 1.
More cyclomatic complexity, more complex the software, more complex the **testing** and less **understandable** it becomes. (Because there will be lots of possible execution paths depending on conditions.)

## Regression testing
Regress means to return to a previous, usually worse state.
When a program is changed from P1 to P2. While testing P2, we don't only verify that change P2-P1 works, we also want to verify that the unchanged part P1 also works.
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240113135714.png)
The best time to perform regression testing is 
- after the software has been modified.
- when the environment that is running the software has been modified.

## Static testing
Testing of a software without executing it on a computer.
- code reviews
- static code analysis

Guide to Advanced Software Testing

**Generally static testing is performed first obviously.**
# Ad hoc testing
done without planning and documentation.
# Performance testing
A compiler might be tested to check if it meets the performance requirements stated in terms of the number of lines of code compiled per second.
A well performed application is one that lets the end user carry out a given task without undue perceived delay or irritation. Performance really is in the eye of the beholder.
**It is non-functional testing.**
# Incremental testing
Unit test->integration test->system test.
# Big bang testing
Testing entire program at once.

# SQA
Quality management in software engineering is known as SQA.
## Quality in software
- compliant software
- quality output
- delivery within budget and schedule
## SQA plan for project
- Evaluations to be performed
- Audits
- Documentation
Amount of technical work isn't a SQA plan.
## Appraisal cost in SQA
- inter-process inspection
- maintenance
- testing
Cost of activities that are designed to find quality problems.
# Statistical quality assurance
Find defects.
Find its cause.
Find 20% of cause that causes 80% of defects.
And start fixing it.
# Formal technical reviews
Find errors so that they don't become big defects after release of software.
# Review summary report
What was reviewed?
Who reviewed?
What were the findings?
# CMMI
- answers the question "how mature are my software development workflow?"
- software CMM, people CMM, systems engineering CMM
Capability Maturity Model Integration
It doesn't recommend processes but it assesses the maturity of existing process.
5 maturity levels of organization
1) initial:
2) repeatable
3) defined
4) managed
5) optimized
## Initial
- ad-hoc
- informal
- not documented
- Project success depends on a particular team member's efforts.
- low quality, full of errors, running over time and budget project.
## Repeatable
- partial documented
- process is repeatable but success is not guarenteed.
- Some project management tools are used.
- SQA
## Defined
- 100% documented
- past experiences valued
- project management done ALL.
## Managed
- metrics collected
- predict future
## Optimized
- use metrics to optimize
# Software configuration management
Typical SCM tool provides functionalities dealing with software revision and version management, software build and release management, software change management, and software auditing. 
- control and maintenance of objects generated by software development and maintenance process.
- tracks
	- change request
	- versions of system components
	- release of system versions to customers
## Software configuration management activity
- identify configuration item
- release management
- branch management
- risk management isn't a part of this.

# GRASP pattern
General **Responsibility Assignment** Software Pattern
It's a mental model to help object oriented design.
- Expert
	- Who is responsible?
	- Assign a responsibility to the information expert.
	- Expert is a class that has all the information necessary to fulfill the responsibilities.
- Creator
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240119112320.png)
	- Who creates?
	- Assign class B the responsibility to create an instance of class A if any of the following is true:
		- B contains A
		- B aggregates A
		- B has the initializing data for A
		- B records A
		- B closely uses A
- Controller
	- Who handles system events?
	- Assign the responsibility for handling a system event message to a class like below (any one true is alright)
		- Business or overall organization(a facade controller).
		- The overall "system" (a facade controller).
		- An animated thing in the domain that would perform the work (a role controller).
		- An artificial class(pure fabrication) representing the use-case(a use-case contoller).
- Low Coupling
	- How to support low dependency and increased reuse?
	- Assign responsibilities so that coupling remains low.
- High Cohesion
	- How to keep complexity manageable?
	- Assign responsibilities so that complexity remains low.
- Polymorphism
	- How to handle alternatives based on type?
- Pure fabrication
	- Low coupling, high cohesion support
- Indirection
	- Avoid direct coupling.
	- Use a mediator.
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240119115729.png)
- Don't talk to strangers
	- Law of delimiter.
	- Client should not need to know about its indirect object. 
	- The responsibility to talk to indirect object of client should be of direct object.
- Protected variation
	- stable interfaces for parts of system that we think are likely to change.
	- protect system from variation.

## Singleton
- doesn't deal with client server interactions.
- developer of a class wants to ensure that there will never be more than 1 instance of class created.

## Observer
- Reduce interconnections between two classes.
- How can objects communicate with each other without any information of which class they belong to?
- one-to-many dependency among objects.
## Delegation 
- if class1 needs an operation which class2 already has, we need this pattern.
- don't inherit, associate.
timothy lethbridge
## Adapter
Two incompatible objects connected using adapter.
different signatures, same methods.
## Facade
How do you simplify the view that programmers have of a complex package?
promotes weak coupling.
# Behavioral Patterns
- communication between objects
# Player-Role Pattern
- Avoid multiple inheritance.
- How do you best model players and roles so that a player can change roles or
possess multiple roles?
# Chain of responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility pattern establishes a chain within a system, so that a message can either be handled at the level where it is first received, or be directed to an object that can handle it. 
Reduces coupling.
# TRUE FALSE
The level of coupling alone can't be considered in isolation from other principles such as expert and high cohesion.
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240119134810.png)
Facade means a block that represents an entire system or subsystem. Facade pattern promotes weak coupling between subsystem and its clients.
An interface-as-controller design decreases the opportunity to reuse logic in future applications.
High cohesion when someone does less amount of things by themselves and delegates more tasks to others.

## Association Labels
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240119145536.png)
Two types:
- Association names
- Role names
Association name is a verb or verb phrase.
If both omit, association has "has" by default.
# Heuristics
- Name classes, attributes and roles with noun phrases.
- Name operations and association with verb phrases.
- Capitalize class names but not attribute, operation, association and rolenames.
- Stick to binary associations.
- Prefer association names to rolenames.
