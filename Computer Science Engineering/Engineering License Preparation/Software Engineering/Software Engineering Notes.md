# Good software
- software isn't manufactured in the classical sense, it's developed or engineered.
- software doesn't "wear out".
- software can be custom built or custom build.
- maintainability
- functionality
- firmness
- commodity
- delight
# Software design principle
- no tunnel vision
- don't reinvent the wheel
# Software Engineering
is defined as systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach for the development, operation and maintenance of software.
# RAD
- Rapid Application Development
- less than 90 days software.
- 5 phases
- user needs to be involved in RAD and prototyping to get desired output.
## drawbacks
- requires highly skilled devs.
- it increases the component reusability.
# Software project management
- project planning
- scope management
- project estimation
# Software requirement specification(SRS)
- functional requirement
	- **functionality, portability and reliability** isn't functional requirement. They're non-functional requirements.
	- business needs is a functional requirement.
- non-functional requirement
- goals for implementation
- doesn't contain the algorithm for software implementation.
- unambiguous.
- also called black box specification.
# Waterfall model
- simplest model of SDLC.
- not suitable to accommodate changes.
# Evolutionary process model
- incremental, concurrent development and WINWIN spiral model isn't relate to it.
# Verification and validation model
- V-model
# System analysis
- understand software limitations.
- learning system related problems.
- impact of project on organization and personnel.
- study of an existing system.
# Architectural design
- software is a system.
# Software
- programs
- docs
- operating procedures
# Spiral model
- risk management is most important feature.
- two dimensions
	- radial
	- angular
- risk analysis performed on every loop.
- spiral and prototyping model doesn't necessitate defining requirements at the earliest in the lifecycle.
- barry boehm founder
# Prototyping model
- vertical
- horizontal
- domain
- diagonal doesn't exist.
- Both RAD and prototyping model facilitates reusability of components.
- spiral and prototyping model doesn't necessitate defining requirements at the earliest in the lifecycle.
# Iterative model
- simpler to manage
- divided workload
- early revenue generation
# Incremental testing
- top-down
- non-functional
- functional
- big-bang is not a type of it.
# Requirement engineering
- elicitation
- analysis
- validation
- design is not a part of requirements engineering
# Software testing lifecycle
- test case design
- test execution
- defect tracking
- maintainence
- coding is not a phase in this lifecycle.
# Software development life cycle
- preliminary investigation and analysis
## Planning and designing phase
- parallel run
- sizing
- specification freeze
# Model selection
- requirements
- dev team and users
- project type and associated risk
# Advanced version of existing software
- iterative
- RAD
# Agile
- incremental
- iterative
## Agile manifesto
- customer collaboration
- individuals and interactions
- working software
# Adaptive software development(ASD)
- assumption
- association
- learning
# Sustained development of legacy systems
- reverse
- re-engineering
# Build and fix model
- between 100-200 LOC
# Agile scrum methodology
- project management that emphasizes incremental progress.
# CASE
- Computer-Aided Software Engineering
# Software design models
- 2 dimensions
	- abstraction
	- process
# Software design concepts
- abstraction
- architecture
- it's not low cohesion and high coupling.
# Software design
- constraints
- changing requirements
- describes the software
# Structural design
- specification model
**Design Notation is not a symbolic representation system**
# Architectural design
- meets system's functional requirement is not the truth.
- testing the system is not architectural design decision.
- application types
- system distribution
- architectural styles or patterns
# Physical view
- hardware and software 
# Architectural conflict
- large-grain components improves performance but reduces maintainability.
- redundant data improves availability but decrease security.
- localizing safety-related features increase communication, decreases performance
# Shared database or repository pattern
- set of inter-acting components can share data.
# Architectural model
- static structural 
- dynamic process
- distribution
# Explicit architecture
- stakeholder communication
- system analysis
- large scale re-use
# Performance
architecture and system characteristic
# System organization styles
- shared data repository
- shared services and servers
- abstract machine or layered
# Repository model
- shared data in central db and accessible by all sub-systems.
- each sub-system maintains its own db and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.
