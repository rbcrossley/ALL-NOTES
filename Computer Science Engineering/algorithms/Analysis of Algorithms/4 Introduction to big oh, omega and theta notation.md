A function can have 3 bounds
- upper(max)
- lower(min)
- tight
Example: You are in 10th floor then the upper bound is 11,12,13... whereas the lower bound is 9,8,7...

# Types of Asymptotic Notation
- Big
	- Big oh=Upper bound (worst case)
	- Big omega= Lower bound
	- Theta= Tight bound
- Small
	- Little oh= Proper upper bound
	- Little omega= Proper lower bound

- I can have many upper bounds and many lower bounds for a function.
- I just need to find the closest lower or upper bound, also called as tight bound.

All these graphs are telling that till the point $n_0$, anything can happen, but after that what's defined will happen in graph.
