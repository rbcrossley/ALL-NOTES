# Definition
The operating system is a set of software programs than acts as an interface between the application program and hardware.
# functions of operating systems
Information management
- set of services used for storing, retrieving, modifying or removing the information on various devices.
Example
- organization of the information in terms of directories and files
- allocating and deallocating the sectors to various files
- access control and permissions

Process management
- running program is a process.
The function of operating system in this regard are as follows
- keep track of all competing processes
- schedule them
- dispatch(run or execute) them
- while doing all of this, try to give the user an impression that he has the full control over the CPU.

Memory management
- allocate memory 
- address translation
# System calls
System calls are an interface provided to communicate with the operating system.
Generally operating system manages entire functioning of a computer on its own, but on many occasions explicit direct(initiated by the user through program or using commands) or indirect(not initiated by the user directly) calls are required to perform various operations.
Routines or functions or calls that are used to perform operating system functions are called as system calls. Most of the system calls are available in the form of commands.
Example of system call is fopen.
The parameters taken by this system call are:
- file id
- mode(read, write etc.)
While executing, the system call assumes that the parameters will be available at a pre-defined place. Similarly, the results of the system call or error codes are deposited by the system call also in pre-defined registers or the stack.
The instructions following the system call generated by the compiler pick up these results from these registers and then proceed.
# Virtual Machine Structure and Benefits
![](_resources/Pasted%20image%2020240212233629.png)
VM uses software instead of physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.
A physical host machine can handle multiple VMs.
Each VM is separated from other VMs, even when they're running on the same host.
Used for server virtualization.
Helps to perform tasks that are too risky to perform in a physical host.
Virtual Machine is separated from the rest of the system.
