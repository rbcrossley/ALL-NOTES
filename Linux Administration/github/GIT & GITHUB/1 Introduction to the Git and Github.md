Github is like git but used when you've multiple collaborators generally.

Git allows you to track files in any folder called repository and git preserves history of all the changes that you make with files in this repository.

Git has its own file structure.
Every file is stored in the separate document and every file has a unique hash.
Git is simply persistent hash map that stores key-value pairs.

key=hash of the file
value=content of the file

Git could be used locally without internet and you'd have all the access to files changes history.

## Why git is called distributed version control system?
Because using git, you can collaborate with people and work on same projects.
